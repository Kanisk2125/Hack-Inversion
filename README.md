# Student Portal
(A Student Portal made using HTML, CSS, PHP, mySQL, JavaScript)

A simplified Student Portal featuring Online Assignments (setting up, taking up and analysis), Messaging, Finding users, adding Announcements and lot more. Before setting it up for yourself, enjoy a **live demo** by [clicking here](http://projects.subhalingam.heliohost.org/sportal/) after reading [this](#demo-instructions)

## Features
### Roles
This portal is for everyone-***Admin***, ***Faculties*** and ***Students***. *Admin* has an Admin Panel for doing some administrative work. Let's move on!
### Assignments
This is the highlight of this project! All the three groups have some role to play:
<details>
	<summary><b>Admin</b></summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Accept/Reject Assignment requests from faculty</li>
			<li>Add an assignment for a batch</li>
			<li>Make changes to timings and key</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Faculty</b></summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Request Assignment for one of his batch (one at a time)</li>
			<li>Add, modify and delete Questions</li>
			<li>Submit (answer) key changes after the end-time</li>
			<li>Analyse (in detail) the performance of the batch
		</ul>
		<b>Note:</b> Batch marks will be available only after finalising/freezing the answer key after the end-time
		<i>It is recommended to upload the correct answers after the end-time</i>
	</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Student</b></summary>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Take up an assignment <i>online</i> with timer set in server</li>
			<li>Analyse his/her performance after taking up the assignment</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</details>

For now, questions can be of Single Correct, One or More than one correct, Matrix matching, Single-digit Integer or Numerical type. The Numerical type answers can also support a range of answers, if required.

### Messaging
Make friends, interact with your faculties and get your doubts cleared! Its a nice place for some fun too, but beaware that the messages aren't encrypted and can be seen by the Admin at any time!

### Announcements
Many news keep coming up and this is the place to dump all of them! These include the auto-generated announcements for new assignments for student, official announcements, some message by the faculty, etc. Keep checking for updates so that you donot miss any of them!

### Find user
Everyone in this world is identified by their unique username to avoid confusions and sometimes some random ID can popup in your messages. Find who that is from this *Find user* page. You can also search for the username by the name. Found the person you want? You can drop a message-just press on that *Message* button on the side!

### Profile
View your profile, update your contact details, change your password and update your profile picture. There is nothing else here!

### Admin Panel
These are the special options for the Admin. Add/Remove users, batches, faculty handling the batches and Reset password for the users!
